# Why would I create this projectï¼Ÿ

I like to write useful and interesting scripts. But some scripts have been lost for some reasons. In order to avoid this situation, I create this project. These scripts may not be so perfect, so hopefully someone will improve them.

# Catalog

- ascii.sh (Print ASCII table.)
- d2h.sh (Convert number decimal to hexadecimal.)
- loading_demo.sh (A loading effect demo.)
- msgbox.sh (Some interesting code inside.)
- urlcnv.sh (Encode or decode the Thunder/FlashGet/QQCyclone url.)
- show_all_path.sh (Print the path enviroment variables.)
- [shell_JSON](https://github.com/linzhehuang/sshub/tree/master/shell_JSON) (Parse JSON using shell script.)
- [bmp-shell](https://github.com/linzhehuang/sshub/tree/master/bmp-shell) (Draw bit-map image on character terminal.)
